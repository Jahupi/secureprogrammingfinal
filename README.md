For the final project of Secure Programming, I have created a to-do list manager that allows you to add, remove, view, save and load tasks.

The first version of the to-do list contains no input validation or unit tests, and contains the possibility of memory leaks and data loss.
You can view both the old and new versions in this respository, with the new version containing fixes for all the before mentioned issues.

I have also added automatic GitHub testing into this repository.
